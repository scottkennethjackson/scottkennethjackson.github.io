However, you should not use <span class="tag">&lt;b&gt;</span> for styling text or granting importance. If you wish to create boldface text, you should use the CSS font-weight property. If you wish to indicate an element is of special importance, you should use the <span class="tag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element.</td>
