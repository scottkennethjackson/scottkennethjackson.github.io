        <h1>HTML Elements</h1>
        <div class="blurb">
            <p><strong>HTML</strong> (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (<strong>CSS</strong>) or functionality/behavior (<strong>JavaScript</strong>).</p>
            <p>HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in the Web browser. This markup consists of special characters called "<strong>elements</strong>", which are instructions that tell the browser how to display content to the user.</p>
            <p>Elements are made up of three parts: an opening tag, the content itself, and a closing tag. The two <strong>tags</strong> are like containers - they indicate the tag's purpose and instruct the browser about the type of information that lies between them. The <strong>content</strong> is what gets displayed to the user.</p>
            <p>Below is a list of HTML tags, with information about their functionality and usage:</p>
        </div>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Tag</th>

                    <td>Represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content.</td>

It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the <span class="tag">&lt;source&gt;</span> element: the browser will choose the most suitable one. It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a MediaStream.</td>

                    <td>Used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use <span class="tag">&lt;b&gt;</span> for styling text or granting importance. If you wish to create boldface text, you should use the CSS font-weight property. If you wish to indicate an element is of special importance, you should use the <span class="tag">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element.</td>

                    <td>Tells the browser's bidirectional algorithm to treat the text it contains in isolation from its surrounding text. It's particularly useful when a website dynamically inserts some text and doesn't know the directionality of the text being inserted.</td>
